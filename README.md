Dragsim.co Rare Drop Alert CT Module.

To use it go to your .minecraft folder, Then open "config", Then "ChatTriggers", and finally put the file into "modules"


!IMPORTANT!
Github Sucks or Im dumb but this is necessary


When downloading the ZIP file from github,
1: You have to unzip it, And it will give you a RareDropAlert-main File
2: Open that file and you will see another RareDropAlert-main File
3: Open that file and you will see the "DragonDropAlert" file, This is the file you must put into the modules folder for chattriggers



If you use the module and like it please star this repo :)
